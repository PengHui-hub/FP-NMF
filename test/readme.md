# test
This is a test example, and the case is same to the uppel panels of Figure 2 in Peng et al. (2024).

```input_powerspectra.npy``` is the input power spectra between photometric redshift bins.   
```sigma.npy``` is the input file used to cacluate the weight.   
```recon.npz``` is the output file including the objective functions, the scattering matrices, the power spectra between true-z bins.
