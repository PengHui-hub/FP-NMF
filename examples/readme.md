# test

This is a test example running on ```example.py```, with same case as the uppel panels of Figure 2 in Peng et al. ([2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240604407P/abstract)).

```input_powerspectra.npy``` is the input power spectra between photometric redshift bins.   
```sigma.npy``` is the input file used to calculate the weight.   
```recon.npz``` is the output file including the objective functions, the scattering matrices and the power spectra between true-z bins.
